# Tutorial Background
## What
Reflections are a very powerful tool in Java which allow us to perform self introspection. Reflections can seem really
intimidating even when you have a decent grasp on the language, but once you get the hang of them they become scared of
YOU.

## Inspiration
I've worked with several UIs professionally which aren't quite monolithic, but they do contain both front end code, and
some intermediary back end code - that's to say the Angular (for example) isn't calling services directly, it's calling
back into its Java side to perform some processing. While there are some incredible tutorials out there on how to perform
a basic reflection, I wanted to expand my experience of real life examples where I could apply reflections in a meaningful
and useful way, not just because I could. The goal of this example is to show you a niche-ish version of a web backend where
reflections cut down on your ongoing feature additions significantly.

## Disclaimer
I created this tutorial in my personal time to expand my knowledge of Java reflections and apply them in new ways. I then
converted it from a self learning project to a tutorial-like project so others could learn from it. I've presented this
tutorial several times in person professionally. Although this tutorial is my own content, in the `documents` folder you
can find permission waivers from the companies to whom I've presented this.
