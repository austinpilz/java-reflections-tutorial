# Java Reflections Tutorial
This is tutorial of multiple flavors of [Java Reflections](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javareflection.html)
with integrated application examples. I built this tutorial years ago when I wanted to teach myself applications of reflections
and have modified it for others to follow along.

## Getting Started
1) Review the [project background](resources/background.md) for an introduction to the layout of this project and the
background assumptions we'll be making.
2) UI [action reflection tutorial](resources/actionTutorial.md) for reflection example on how to improve UI to UI-packaged
backend communication.
3) Intermediate layer [command tutorial](resources/commandTutorial.md) for software layer reflection example.
